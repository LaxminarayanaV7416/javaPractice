- ***Contention***: is a situation where multiple processes or threads are competing for access to a shared resource. This can lead to performance degradation, as the processes or threads have to wait for each other to finish using the resource before they can proceed.
- ***Coherence***: is a property of a system where all copies of a shared resource are consistent with each other. This means that if one process or thread updates the resource, all other processes or threads that are using the resource will see the updated value.
- ***volatile***: The volatile keyword in Java is used to ensure that reads and writes to a variable are always performed from and to main memory. This is important in multithreaded programming, where multiple threads may be accessing the same variable at the same time.
