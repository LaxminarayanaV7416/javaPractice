# Structural Design Pattern
* Structural design patterns are a powerful tool for improving the design of software applications. By using these patterns, developers can create code that is more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

## Adapter
---------------
> Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.


## Bridge
---------------
> Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.


## Composite
---------------
> Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.



## Decorator
---------------
> Allows adding new functionality to existing objects without modifying their classes.


## Facade
---------------
> Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem


## Flyweight
---------------
> Reduces memory usage by sharing common objects.


## Proxy
---------------
> Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
