# Behavioral Design Patterns
* Behavioral design patterns are concerned with how objects communicate and interact with each other. They provide solutions to common problems that occur when designing the behavior of software systems.


## Chain of Responsibility
----------------------
> Chain of responsibility allows you to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain.


## Command
----------------------
> Command turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This allows you to decouple the sender of the request from the receiver of the request.


## Iterator
----------------------
> Iterator provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.

## Mediator
----------------------
> Mediator provides a central place for objects to communicate with each other without having to know about each other directly.


## Memento
----------------------
> Memento allows you to save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.


## Observer
----------------------
> Observer allows you to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.


## State
----------------------
> State allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.


## Strategy
----------------------
> Strategy allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This lets you change the algorithm used by an object at runtime without changing the object's structure.


## Template Method
----------------------
> Template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Subclasses can override the deferred steps to provide specific implementations.


## Visitor
----------------------
> Visitor allows you to define an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. You can visit the elements of the structure without changing their classes.


## Interpreter
----------------------
> Interpreter allows you to define a grammar for a language and then create an interpreter to execute programs written in that language.
