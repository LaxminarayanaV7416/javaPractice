### Core Java Basics
------------------
1. Java coding is different from python, where java have the compiler called javac where initially before we execute the code we need to compile the code using javac and later we will get the ".class" files where we can use the JVM and run the compiled code where we can simply call the java followed by class name without .class extension (Note: this java class should have the mail method in the code else it wont compile nor run.)
2. I have learned the java from Telusko channel where I did have some idea how java works since am a solution architect working from past 4 years in software industry, here is the link to the video [Telusko Youtube Link Java-v17](https://youtu.be/BGTx91t8q50)
